# Rotary Global Grant Scholarship — Project Brief (One Pager)

## Project title
**The Hive x Anti-Fraud: Community Safety & Digital Resilience Program**

## Areas of Focus (primary + secondary)
- **Promoting peace** (primary): reduce panic, misinformation escalation, and community conflict during incidents.
- **Supporting education** (secondary): anti-fraud + digital safety literacy via repeatable training modules.

## Problem statement
Public incidents and scams create avoidable harm when:
- reporting channels are fragmented
- verification is slow
- fake “official” alerts spread faster than trusted guidance
- communities lack practical training and rehearsal (tabletop/drills)

## Intervention (3-part)
1) **Community reporting + verification** (The Hive): intake → evidence → triage → decision log → audit trail.
2) **Tiered alerts in CAP-ready format**: consistent messages across channels; “do/don’t” actions.
3) **Education & training** (Anti-Fraud): workshops, micro-lessons, train-the-trainer, and evaluation.

## Beneficiaries
Direct:
- commuters, students, venue/campus users
- high-risk groups: older adults, migrants/new residents, low digital literacy

Indirect:
- campus/venue operators, NGOs, community volunteers (including Rotary members)

## Partner types
- International sponsor (home country Rotary club/district)
- Host sponsor (study country Rotary club/district)
- Cooperating orgs: campus security, community centers, NGOs, civic tech groups

Education:
- Workshops ≥ 12
- Trained participants ≥ 300
- Pre/post knowledge improvement ≥ +25%
