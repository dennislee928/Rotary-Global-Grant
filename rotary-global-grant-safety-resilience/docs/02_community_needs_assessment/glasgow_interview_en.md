# Glasgow/Scotland CNA Interview Guide (45–60 minutes)

## How to use
- Obtain verbal consent (notes only is fine)
- Avoid collecting sensitive personal data
- Ask for a recent real event first to ground the conversation

---

## Track A — Beneficiaries (commuters/students/residents)
1) Tell me about the most recent safety/scam/misinformation incident you experienced. What did you do?
2) What information or support did you lack at that moment?
3) Which sources do you trust for urgent updates, and why?
4) Rank concerns: false reporting, spam, privacy, retaliation, slow response.
5) What must be included in a “tiered alert + action checklist” to be useful?
6) What data are you willing to provide (time/area/photo/contact)?
7) Would you join training (online/workshop/tabletop/drill)?

## Track B — Site operators (campus/venue/security)
1) What is your current SOP for incidents? Where does it fail?
2) Which incident types are most concerning in your setting?
3) What constitutes “actionable evidence” for you?
4) What are your red lines for community volunteers assisting triage?
5) What tools/channels do you already use (radio/WhatsApp/forms/dashboards)?
6) What pilot type would you accept (tabletop/drill/lightweight deployment)?
7) Which operational KPIs matter to you (time-to-triage, false reports, drill pass rate)?

## Track C — Partners (NGOs/Rotary/community organisations)
1) What safety/anti-fraud education have you done? How did you measure outcomes?
2) What’s missing most: curriculum, trainers, tools, or distribution?
3) What resources can you provide (venue, volunteers, promotion, expert contacts)?
4) What reputational risks do you worry about (panic, politicisation, media)?
5) What deliverables do you want (training kit, trainer certification, public report, open-source tooling)?
