# Semi-live Drill (120 minutes)

## Objective
Test the workflow with actual tooling:
- report intake
- triage queue operations
- alert drafting and publishing
- micro-lesson delivery
- KPI timestamp capture

## Agenda
0–15: Briefing (roles, do-no-harm, privacy)
15–45: Live reporting (role players submit reports with varying evidence quality)
45–75: Triage + tiered alert publishing (min 2 messages)
75–95: Education micro-lesson (10–15 minutes) + Q&A
95–120: AAR + KPI table completion

## Safety rules
- No real public broadcasting
- Use a closed channel (test email list / internal dashboard)
- Avoid real identities in reports
