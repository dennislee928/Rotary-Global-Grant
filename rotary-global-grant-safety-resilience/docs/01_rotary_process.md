# Rotary Global Grant Scholarship — “How to Apply” (Practical Process)

## Key reality
You typically **do not** submit directly to The Rotary Foundation as an individual candidate.
In practice, **a Rotary club or district sponsors you** and initiates the grant workflow; you are then invited
into the Grant Center process.

## Minimal execution steps (do this order)

### Step 1 — Prepare your sponsor-ready packet
Deliverables you should have before outreach:
- One-pager: `docs/00_project_brief_one_pager.md`
- CNA package: `docs/02_community_needs_assessment/`
- KPI + M&E: `docs/03_kpi_and_me/`
- Pilot playbooks: `docs/04_pilot_playbooks/`
- Your university offer/programme info (PDF/email)
- Scholar profile (1 page) + CV

### Step 2 — Secure an **international sponsor** (home country)
- Identify nearby Rotary clubs/district contacts.
- Request a 20–30 minute meeting.
- In the meeting: clarify which Area(s) of Focus you align with and what measurable outputs you will deliver.

### Step 3 — Secure a **host sponsor** (study country)
- Identify clubs near your study location (e.g., Glasgow).
- Ask for a host sponsor role (co-ownership, local introductions, hosting events/workshops).

### Step 4 — Sponsors initiate the application in the Grant Center
- The sponsor begins the global grant application and adds you as the scholarship candidate.
- You receive an invitation to complete your candidate profile and required details.

### Step 5 — Run the plan and report
Maintain:
- financial tracking (retain receipts above the local threshold)
- progress reporting
- evidence and evaluation (KPI tables, attendance, pre/post tests, AARs)

## Outputs Rotary sponsors usually want early
- Community needs assessment plan + initial results
- Clear safeguarding/abuse prevention policy
- Pilot schedule (tabletop & drill)
- A realistic, auditable budget & spending controls

## Files to use for sponsor conversations
- Sponsor checklist: `docs/07_outreach/sponsor_checklist.md`
- Meeting agenda: `docs/07_outreach/meeting_agenda.md`
- Email templates: `docs/07_outreach/email_templates/`
