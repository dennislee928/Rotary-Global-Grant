# Abuse Prevention & Safeguarding (Draft)

## Threats
- Spam reporting, brigading, targeted harassment
- Fake “official notices” / phishing link injection
- Doxxing attempts via report content
- Vigilantism / escalation risks

## Controls
- Rate limiting by IP/device/session
- Evidence gating for higher severity broadcasts
- Reputation signals (non-identity-based where possible)
- Human-in-the-loop review for public-facing messages
- Appeal workflow (for wrongly blocked reporters)

## Communications safeguards
- Avoid inflammatory labels
- Use factual, non-accusatory language
- Provide “do/don’t” actions and official verification guidance
