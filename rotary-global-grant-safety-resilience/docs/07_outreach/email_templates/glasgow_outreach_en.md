Subject: Exploring Global Grant Scholarship host sponsorship — Community safety & anti-fraud resilience pilot

Hello [Name/Club Officer],

My name is [Your Name]. I am preparing for graduate study in Glasgow and building a Rotary-aligned project
focused on community safety, crisis communication, and anti-fraud education (Promoting peace / Supporting education).

I am seeking a host sponsor club in the Glasgow area to co-sponsor a Global Grant Scholarship proposal.
The project combines a safe reporting/verification workflow (with CAP-ready alert templates) and a repeatable
training kit (workshops + tabletop/drill exercises) to improve digital resilience and reduce panic and misinformation during incidents.

Would your club be open to a 20-minute call to explore host sponsorship and potential local partners
(e.g., campus/venue operators or NGOs) for a small pilot?

I can share a one-page brief, needs assessment survey, KPI plan, and ready-to-run pilot playbooks.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
