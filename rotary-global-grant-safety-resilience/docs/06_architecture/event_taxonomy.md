# Event taxonomy (Draft)

Use a small taxonomy to avoid overfitting and reduce panic.

## Categories
- suspicious_item
- suspicious_person
- harassment_stalking
- scam_phishing
- misinformation_panic
- crowd_disorder

- other

## Severity (example)
- S0: informational (education-only)
- S1: low risk (monitor)
- S2: moderate (targeted notification)
- S3: high (requires site operator confirmation)
- S4: critical (requires authority confirmation; avoid public panic)

## Evidence levels
- E0: none (text only)
- E1: weak (single blurry photo)
- E2: moderate (clear photo + consistent details)
- E3: strong (multiple independent sources or site operator confirmation)
