# Minimal M&E SOP (Workshops + Incidents)

## For each workshop
Collect:
1) Attendance (anonymous code is OK)
2) Pre-test (5–10 questions)
3) Post-test (same or isomorphic)
4) 5-item satisfaction survey
5) Notes: what worked/what didn’t + key questions asked

Store:
- raw CSV exports
- a 1-page monthly rollup (counts + deltas)

## For each incident / alert
Record:
- Report metadata (time, approximate area, incident type)
- Evidence provided (files, descriptions) — minimize personal data
- Triage decision + rationale
- Alerts published (message IDs, timestamps)
- Abuse handling actions (rate limiting, blocks, appeals)
- Post-incident AAR link

## Monthly rollup
- KPI summary chart/table
- 1 page “narrative” (top 3 incidents, top 3 lessons)
- Open issues backlog updates
