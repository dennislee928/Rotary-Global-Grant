# Tabletop Exercise (90 minutes) — “Suspicious Item + Fake Official Alert”

## Objective
Validate:
- reporting → evidence → triage → tiered alert → anti-fraud clarification
- safeguarding and abuse handling
- communications that reduce panic (do-no-harm)

## Participants (12–18)
Suggested roles:
- Incident Commander (IC)
- Verification Lead
- Triage Operator(s)
- Comms Lead (CAP message draft)
- Safeguarding Lead (abuse, privacy, appeals)
- Education Lead (micro-lesson + action checklist)
- Rotary Liaison
- Observers/Evaluators

## Tools (minimum)
- Sample report form (paper or online)
- Decision log sheet
- CAP template (see `cap_message_templates.md`)
- Whiteboard timeline

## Scenario
A high-traffic transit/campus-adjacent location receives:
1) reports of a suspicious item/person
2) simultaneous spread of a fake “official evacuation notice” with a phishing link

Goal: prevent panic and prevent phishing while enabling safe, appropriate action.

## Inject timeline (facilitator script)
- T+0: Report #1 (text + blurry photo; vague location)
- T+10: Report #2 (more precise location; contradictory details)
- T+20: Fake “official alert” spreads; link looks suspicious
- T+30: Site operator cannot confirm yet; requests “do not escalate panic”
- T+40: Malicious spam reports arrive (abuse attempt)
- T+55: Social media starts using “terror/attack” language (panic rising)
- T+70: Update: likely lost item, still under check
- T+85: Require final update + education message

## Required outputs (deliverables)
1) **Initial status update** (low-panic, actionable)
2) **Anti-fraud clarification** (immediate, explicit, safe link guidance)
3) **Final update + education** (transparent close-out + next time guidance)

## Evaluation checklist

- Action checklist included: yes/no
- Fake link contained (explicit “do/don’t”): yes/no
- Abuse handling executed (rate-limit/block/appeal): yes/no
